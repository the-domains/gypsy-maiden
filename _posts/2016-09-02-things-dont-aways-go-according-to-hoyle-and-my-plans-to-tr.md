  Things don’t aways go according to Hoyle, and my plans to trek across from
  California to western NY will be delayed owing to the failure of both in tank
  fuel pumps the day before her maiden run. (which also was put back since she
  would not start even with efforts that would make McGyver proud.  Having been
  informed that Ford’s are notorious for having the fuel pump go bad if left
  idle too long, it seems prudent to search for an alternative without the
  reputation of failure that Ford seems to have on this account.
