description: 'So I had saved up the money for my root canal over the year when this advert caught my eye for a 1984 London Aire motor home for sale in Nevada.. just one state over... So I went and looked it over, the inside was partially gutted, the refrigerator was non existent, but the engine fired right up.  The price was pretty much what I had saved for the root canal. So the Gypsy Maiden Project was born. She will be a traveling lab/sewing room/festival vendor transport/and part time home as I peddle my quilts and salves across the countryside. That said, she is in the renovation and repair phase which I am some behind on owing to ill health at the beginning of this year (and the start of the project.)  I am still trying to talk myself into videos (i am a dichotomy being a photographer and camera shy all in the same breathe)'
