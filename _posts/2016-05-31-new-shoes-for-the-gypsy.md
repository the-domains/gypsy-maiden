I did find them at one place but that place said they could not put them on my vehicle.  Then I found a place that said they could put them on but they did not have the tires... I even found online I could get them shipped to my door cheaper than the place that had them but could not put them on.  I have a guy I am working with to put solar on the Gypsy, and take out the generator, make a few upgrades and I was lamenting to him the problem of finding the tires where they could also put them on and he said.. I gotta guy....    So I just got off the phone, and not only will they beat the price I got locally but they are going to come out to my house, put the tires on the coach where she sits.... and that service? $70 more is all.  One more task in the preparation of the Gypsy Maiden to get on the road.'
