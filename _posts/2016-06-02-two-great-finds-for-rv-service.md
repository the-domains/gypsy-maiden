description: "Colin Fullam of Retro Odyssey http://www.retroodyssey.com/ told me on the phone before we ever met, that his specialty was \"un-mickey mousing\" things... which I admit I smiled at since.. well.. I tend to fabricate or find work arounds when needed that technically could be considered.. mickey mousing... which we had sort of a laugh about when we actually did meet as he was somewhat impressed with some of my solutions and work arounds.  So while we were discussing what I wanted done, and going over things, I mentioned I was having trouble finding a place that had the tire size I needed and the ability to put them on... and Colin gave me his tire guy's number.. so my second great find locally is Commercial Tire Center 7740 Gloria, Van Nuys CA. They came out and changed six tires in my driveway. "
