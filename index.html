So I went and looked it over, the inside was partially gutted, the refrigerator was non existent, but the engine fired right up. The price was pretty much what I had saved for the root canal. So the Gypsy Maiden Project was born. She will be a traveling lab/sewing room/festival vendor transport/and part time home as I peddle my quilts and salves across the countryside. That said, she is in the renovation and repair phase which I am some behind on owing to ill health at the beginning of this year (and the start of the project.) I am still trying to talk myself into videos (i am a dichotomy being a photographer and camera shy all in the same breathe)</p></div></div></div></section><section id="3" class="Section

experience in solar installations on RV's, and basic electric knowledge, I found Colin Fullam of Retro Odyssey http://www.retroodyssey.com/ who told me on the phone his specialty was "un-mickey mousing" things. I smiled as with vintage RV's some parts simply are no longer available, so sometimes you need to get a little creative to work around a problem or create a solution... fabricate a part.. sometimes the fabrications look pretty good, sometimes not so much.. Anyway, Colin and I had a bit of a chuckle over the mickey mousing thing but he seemed relatively impressed with some of the things I showed him I had done on Gypsy. During our discussion of what I wanted/needed done, I mentioned the trouble I was having finding tires and a place that would put them on Gypsy. (they are an odd size apparently, they don't make the tires that are on her anymore, and places that had the tires did not want to put them on.. maybe because of the age of the coach...) And that brings me to my second find, Colin came up with Commercial Tire Center, on Gloria in Van Nuys, CA who came out and put six new tires on my coach in my driveway. </p></div></div></div></section><section id="10" class="Section Section--components-2 p-h-0 ls-p-h-13vw p-v-2 ls-p-v-8 color-title title-size-small section-bgcover-wo  color-bg group-graphical-shape-circle  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="186"><div class="Component ls-fx-r j-c-center p-h-1 t-a-l a-i-start " data-reactid="187"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 fx-b-50p" data-reactid="188"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="189"><h1 data-reactid="190"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="191"><span class="font-title" data-reactid="192">New Shoes for the Gypsy</span></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 193 --><!-- react-empty: 194 --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="195"><p data-reactid="196">Finding parts for vintage motor homes is sometimes impossible. That just means it takes a bit longer. (although truth be told I still am in search of the probe that allows my microwave to cook by temperature as well as by time... ) I did not expect it to be hard to find tires of the appropriate size and type. I did find them at one place but that place said they could not put them on my vehicle. Then I found a place that said they could put them on but they did not have the tires... I even found online I could get them shipped to my door cheaper than the place that had them but could not put them on. I have a guy I am working with to put solar on the Gypsy, and take out the generator, make a few upgrades and I was lamenting to him the problem of finding the tires where they could also put them on and he said.. I gotta guy.... So I just got off the phone, and not only will they beat the price I got locally but they are going to come out to my house, put the tires on the coach where she sits.... and that service? $70 more is all. One more task in the preparation of the Gypsy Maiden to get on the road.</p></div></div></div><div class="Component ls-fx-r j-c-center p-h-1 t-a-l a-i-start " data-reactid="197"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 fx-b-50p" data-reactid="198"><a href="https://scontent-sjc2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13241162_276178886055762_2436449761703160713_n.jpg?oh=74714738a400310ba34dbdf8aba45cd1&amp;oe=57D57D6B" class="" data-reactid="199"><div class="Cover" data-reactid="200"><img class="color-loading" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-ratio="1.7777777777777777" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/555ec06619e4aad83adc104d3f821090/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F2337365e9c8f0fb8b80d0f5892464cacf4448ba8.jpg&amp;width=960" style="object-position:76.66666666666667% 56.2962962962963%;" data-reactid="201"/></div></a></div></div></section><section id="11" class="Section Section--components-3 p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title title-size-small section-bgcover-wo  color-bg text-align-left group-graphical-shape-square  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="202"><div class="Component color-title p-1 " data-reactid="203"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 fx-b-50p" data-reactid="204"><a href="https://scontent-sjc2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13100807_271610759845908_3131019970486146686_n.jpg?oh=075f7f4d3063af7f5a5fd50515ba5003&amp;oe=57D610E1" class="" data-reactid="205"><div class="Cover" data-reactid="206"><img class="color-loading" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-ratio="1.7777777777777777" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/231330bfe53c123f4c666c5799f6a6d4/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F54ce82042adade558ef3e385daaea24e074e549c.jpg&amp;width=960" style="object-position:75.67708333333333% 46.48148148148148%;" data-reactid="207"/></div></a></div></div><div class="Component color-title p-1 " data-reactid="208"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 fx-b-50p" data-reactid="209"><a href="https://scontent-sjc2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/s480x480/11200812_163827583957560_3160446665656257041_n.jpg?oh=c511ac84b4d7f4591be8728ea8fb1008&amp;oe=57CC14EA" class="" data-reactid="210"><div class="Cover" data-reactid="211"><img class="color-loading" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-ratio="1.7777777777777777" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b7005b75944068c42aecb9aa995fd836/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fd4248ad79aa8c48b7b3a113e3311ef963d05ec9d.jpg&amp;width=480" style="object-position:50.10416666666667% 45.55555555555556%;" data-reactid="212"/></div></a></div></div><div class="Component color-title p-1 " data-reactid="213"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 fx-b-50p" data-reactid="214"><a href="https://scontent-sjc2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13087769_269387970068187_8531689451148274698_n.jpg?oh=eb2e5f821e0bddec0a48a64bf28a758d&amp;oe=57D21D0B" class="" data-reactid="215"><div class="Cover" data-reactid="216"><img class="color-loading" data-width="960" data-height="545" data-ratio="1.761467889908257" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4599db1e3c12c1af1c5d2ae78af5bfa9/insta_1977.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F76c784373d5bf1f6839fba74dfaabec1f9a618dd.jpg&amp;width=960" style="object-position:40.520833333333336% 76.88073394495413%;" data-reactid="217"/></div></a></div></div></section></div><section id="12" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="218"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="219"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="220"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="221"><span data-reactid="222"><!-- react-empty: 223 --><h2 data-reactid="224"><a data-reactid="225">Gypsy Maiden</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="226"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="227"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="228"><div class="Link" data-reactid="229"><a data-reactid="230">Maurine Dodge Photography</a></div></div></div></div><div data-reactid="231"></div></section></div></div>

That just means it takes a bit longer. (although truth be told I still am in search of the probe that allows my microwave to cook by temperature as well as by time... )     I did not expect it to be hard to find tires of the appropriate size and type.  I did find them at one place but that place said they could not put them on my vehicle.  Then I found a place that said they could put them on but they did not have the tires... I even found online I could get them shipped to my door cheaper than the place that had them but could not put them on.  I have a guy I am working with to put solar on the Gypsy, and take out the generator, make a few upgrades and I was lamenting to him the problem of finding the tires where they could also put them on and he said.. I gotta guy....    So I just got off the phone, and not only will they beat the price I got locally but they are going to come out to my house, put the tires on the coach where she sits.... and that service? $70 more is all.
